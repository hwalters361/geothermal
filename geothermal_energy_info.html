				<p>&nbsp Geothermal energy is electricity generated from heat deep within the earth. This heat is created as radioactive particles decay and rises to the surface of the earth slowly. This heat can warm up water circulating through sub-surface cracks in the crust. We can use this hot water to make electricity.</p>
				<p>&nbsp This energy is harnessed by digging wells 1-2 miles down into the earth to access these hot water and steam reservoirs. The steam from this hot water is used to spin a turbine. After being used, the steam condenses back into water and is reinjected back into the ground. These natural geothermal wells are mostly found on tectonic boundaries and sites of geothermal activity. (<i>Energy Choices</i> Page 85).</p>
				<h2>How a geothermal power plant is built</h2>
				<p>The stages of construction of a geothermal power plant are meticulous and expensive. The payoff is the cheap, reliable, and sustainable electricity. The price finding the geothermal wells and hotspots, planning, and final construction. The steps are as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Preliminary survey: </strong>The land is surveyed for possible spots of geothermal activity
					</li>
					<li><strong>Exploration: </strong>More data is gathered to make absolutely sure before test drilling</li>
					<li><strong>Test drilling</strong></li> 
					<li><strong>Project review and planning: </strong>Now that the location has been firmly established, now is the time to plan out the plant itself.</li>
					<li><strong>Field development</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Construction: </strong>Finally, the plant begins construction. This is the most expensive part as the real drilling begins here</li>
					<li><strong>Startup and construction</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Operation and maintenance: </strong>After years of planning and spending the plant is built and the electricity is sold</li>

						<u><h3>Flash steam</h3></u>
						<p><a href = "https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation"><img src = "https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/flashplant.gif.pagespeed.ce.cA7ZnxIQ9-.gif";" /></a>&nbsp Flash steam power plants are the most common type of geothermal energy operating currently. The fluid used to make the energy is greater than 360ºF. It is pumped into a tank at the surface of the earth. Since there is such low pressure in this tank in comparison to the high pressure environment that the fluid was just in, the fluid evaporates rapidly, or "flash". The vapor turns a turbine which creates electricity. If any liquid remains in the first tank, there can be a second tank that flashes it to create more vapor and more electricity ("Electricity Generation.")</p>

						<u><h3>Binary Cycle</h3></u>
						<p><a href = "https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation"><img src = "https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/binaryplant.gif.pagespeed.ce.9XFRo984in.gif" /></a>&nbsp Binary plants specifically use a second working fluid (hence, "binary") with a much lower boiling point than water. The binary fluid is operated through a conventional Rankine cycle. Generally, the working fluid is a hydrocarbon such as isopentane, or a refrigerant. The geothermal fluid (predominantly water vapor) and working fluid pass through a heat exchanger, where the working fluid flashes to vapor and drives the turbines. The cooled water vapor is then released back into the underground reservoirs, so the cycle can begin anew. No gas is emitted to the atmosphere, as the binary cycle is a closed system. (emphasis mine)</p>

						<u><h3>Dry Steam</h3></u>
						<p><a href = "https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation"><img src = "https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/drysteam.gif.pagespeed.ce.UeHxUJvdXC.gif" style = "display: inline" /></a>&nbspDry steam plants use hydrothermal fluids that mostly come in the form of steam. The steam pushed a turbine directly which produces the electricity. These types of plants only emit steam and tiny amounts of gas. They were the first type of geothermal power plant to be made. The first one ever built was build in 1904 in Italy. This form of power plant isn't as used as new and better technology has been developed but it is still in use at They Geysers in northern California. This site is the largest single source of geothermal power. </p>

						<h2><a id = "enhanced_geothermal">Enhanced Geothermal Energy</a></h2>
							<p>&nbspUnlike dry steam, flash steam, or binary cycle, Enhanced Geothermal energy is different than a way of spinning an engine. It is a way to increase rock permeability. It works by pumping cool water into the ground through a drilled well. It factures the bedrock and creates and artificial reservoir. This can cause earthquakes but the resulting geothermal plant lasts longer and provides more power. In addition, it has no emmissions. </p>

					<h2><a id="heat_pump">Geothermal Heat Pumps</a></h2>
					<p>Geothermal energy can be used in a large and small scale. Geothermal heat pumps are small scale systems that can heat or cool a building. They consist of a series of loops buried underground beneath the frost line where the temperature is a constant 50ºF - 60ºF. This is around 10ft below the surface. There is either water or an antifreeze running through the tubes. This acts as a heat exchanger. The water absorbes heat from the earth and uses that heat to warm the house. It can also cool the house, using the same process but using the mild temperatures of the ground below for cooling. Below is a video which describes the process in more detail.</p>

				<h2>Counterpoints to Cons</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> &nbsp Release of Sulphur Dioxide in Flash Steam: The sulphur emmissions in Flash Steam plants are minimal, and Binary geothermal systems have no emmissions what so ever.</li>
					<li> &nbsp Enhanced Geothermal Earthquakes: Enhanced geothermal earthquakes are far smaller than earthquakes made by fraking. And unlike fraking, in which stuff is pumped into the ground, in an enhanced geothermal system water is circulated. The water pumped into the ground doesn't just sit there, it is sucked back out and used for electricity. </li>
					<li> &nbsp Expensive cost of creation: Geothermal plants are expensive to create. However, they produce very cheap electricity. In some places like Geysers California, geothermal energy can cost as low as $0.03 per kWh!</li>

				<h2><a id="location">Where Geothermal is being used</a></h2>
				<img src="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/2015-04-17_Geothermal_Capacity.jpg" style = "max-width: 100%"/>
				<p>Geothermal energy is being used Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah. Arizona, Colordo, and North Dakota are all planning geothermal facilities. The current US capacity for geothermal energy is 3,522 MW, with 12745.35 MW of planned capacity in new geothermal plants being built. The top geothermal producing states are California, Nevada, and Utah, though California, Nevada, and Oregon, and Idaho are all working hard to expand all of their geothermal capacity.</p>
				<p>Geothermal energy made up 2% of all electricity consumed in the US in 2016. And cost from $0.05 - $0.003 per kWh.</p>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Through our research we have come to the conclusion that geothermal energy has great potential. We believe that because geothermal energy is sustainable, energy dense, and cheap that it should be used and developed more than it is currently. With all of the hotspots in the US there is lots of oppourtunity to be taken. Thank you for reading.
